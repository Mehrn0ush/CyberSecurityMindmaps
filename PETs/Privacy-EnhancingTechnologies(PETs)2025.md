# Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

## Cryptographic PETs

### Homomorphic Encryption (HE)

- Definition: 

	-  cryptographic technique allowing computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption.

	- Concept first envisioned by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos in 1978, but fully realized in 2009 by Craig Gentry.

	- Transforms data such that it remains fully encrypted throughout processing—unlocking powerful new privacy-preserving capabilities.

- Applications

	- Secure data processing in cloud environments.

	- Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML).

	- Financial analytics on sensitive data.

- Types

	- Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)

		- Supports either addition or multiplication but not both

		- Examples

			- RSA (multiplicative): Encrypts data and allows multiplicative operations on ciphertexts.

			- Paillier (additive): Enables addition of encrypted numbers without decryption.

		- Limitation & Quantum Resistance Note:

			- Classic PHE schemes (like RSA) are not considered quantum-safe.

	- Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)

		- Supports both addition and multiplication, but only up to a certain limit of operations.

		- Noise Growth & Multiplicative Depth:

			- Repeated operations add noise that can corrupt ciphertexts if not managed.

			- Multiplicative depth determines how many multiplications can occur before noise needs to be “refreshed” (via bootstrapping or related techniques).

		- Ring-Based Schemes & Quantum Resistance:

			- Often built on Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE), believed to be more resistant to quantum attacks than RSA-based schemes.

	- Leveled Fully Homomorphic Encryption (Leveled FHE)

		- Can perform an arbitrary number of operations on encrypted data, provided a pre-defined circuit depth or sequence.

		- Used in complex computations such as ML or secure multi-party computation (MPC), though it requires specifying the “level” of operations ahead of time.

	- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

		- Most advanced form: Unlimited additions and multiplications on encrypted data, without a predefined limit.

		- Cryptosystems like Gentry’s FHE (2009) and modern implementations like CKKS (optimized for real numbers) are used for practical applications.

		- Drawback: Computational overhead is still high, making large-scale real-time applications challenging (but evolving quickly).

		- Historic Perspective:

			- After RSA was introduced in 1977, it took until 2009 for Craig Gentry to publish the first workable FHE scheme.

			- Ongoing research focuses on optimizing FHE performance and noise management.

- Use Case Examples

	- Medical data analysis without exposing patient data.

		- Hospitals can share encrypted patient data with researchers to run AI algorithms on rare disease treatments—no raw data exposure.

	- Aggregating encrypted votes in electronic voting systems.

		- Fine-grained key management can enable distinct decryption keys so that voter identity and vote content remain separate.

		- Partially homomorphic (e.g., Paillier) can securely add up encrypted votes without revealing individual selections.

	- Secure Cloud Computation:

		- Cloud servers compute on encrypted data and return encrypted results. No plaintext is ever exposed in the cloud environment.

	- Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, etc.):

		- Businesses can process users’ encrypted data across borders while maintaining strict privacy requirements.

	- Supply Chain Security:

		- Companies share only encrypted data with vendors or logistics platforms; computations (like inventory analysis) run without revealing the underlying sensitive info.

	- AI/ML on Encrypted Data:

		- Enables training or inference on private datasets (healthcare, finance, genomics) without exposing sensitive features.

- Practical Implementations and Tools

	- Libraries:

		- Microsoft SEAL: A C++ library optimized for FHE with user-friendly interfaces.

		- HELib: Developed by IBM, focusing on Gentry’s FHE implementation.

		- TenSEAL: Python library tailored for machine learning tasks.

	- Frameworks:

		- OpenMined: Integrates homomorphic encryption into federated learning workflows.

		- PALISADE: A comprehensive open-source homomorphic encryption library. It offers lattice-based cryptography solutions and includes both homomorphic encryption and other advanced cryptographic primitives.

- Key Considerations & Advanced Topics:

	- Performance & Noise Management:

		- FHE remains computationally intensive, but ongoing research focuses on faster bootstrapping and noise reduction.

	- Quantum Resistance:

		- RLWE-based schemes (BGV, BFV, CKKS) are considered more secure against potential quantum attacks.

	- Combining with Other Technologies:

		- Can be used alongside trusted execution environments (TEEs) or blockchain-based Web3 systems, enabling advanced privacy-preserving smart contracts and AI solutions.

	- Continued Innovation:

		- Leveled FHE and improved FHE schemes are rapidly developing, unlocking practical solutions for privacy, big data, AI, and beyond.

### Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC)

- Definition:

	- Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) enables multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function using private data while ensuring individual inputs remain confidential. Only the final output is revealed, protecting all other information.

		- Basic Explanation:

			- SMPC provides a “black box” functionality, letting participants collaborate on a shared computation while keeping their personal data secret.

		- Intermediate Explanation:

			- SMPC uses encryption and secret sharing techniques so that the correct function output is jointly computed, but inputs remain private.

		- Advanced Explanation:

			- SMPC can combine secret sharing (e.g., Shamir), homomorphic encryption (e.g., Paillier, ElGamal), and zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs). It ensures:

				- Privacy: No party learns others’ inputs.

				- Accuracy: Malicious parties can’t force an incorrect output.

- Why SMPC Matters

	- Data Privacy: 

		- SMPC ensures private computations in sensitive scenarios, such as hospitals jointly analyzing patient data for disease trends.

	- Regulatory Compliance: 

		- SMPC aligns with GDPR and HIPAA by keeping data encrypted during computation, as seen in privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.

	- Collaboration: 

		- Multiple stakeholders can pool private data (e.g., in healthcare, finance) without compromising individual confidentiality.

- History of SMPC

	- 1970s–1980s: Early special-purpose protocols introduced for tasks like secret sharing. Andrew Yao later formalized secure two-party computation, expanding it to multi-party computation with Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson.

	- 2000s: Focus shifted from theory to making SMPC efficient and practical (e.g., for auctions, DNA comparisons).

	- Late 2010s: Digital asset custodians and other industries began widely adopting MPC. The MPC Alliance formed in 2020 to further standardize and promote the technology.

- Types

	- Secret Sharing-Based SMPC

		- Key Concepts

			- Data is split into shares (e.g., using Shamir’s Secret Sharing), and each participant receives one or more shares.

			- No single share reveals the underlying value—only when shares are combined is the original data recovered.

			- Computations on shares produce an encrypted/secret-shared result, ensuring no raw data is ever exposed.

		- Examples

			- Shamir’s Secret Sharing.

			- Additive secret sharing (like in simple “nurses’ salaries” scenarios).

	- Garbled Circuits

		- Key Concepts

			- Each party creates an encrypted Boolean circuit of the function to compute (e.g., Yao’s Garbled Circuits).

			- Inputs are labels corresponding to wire values, and output labels reveal the final result.

			- While garbled circuits are conceptually powerful, they are computationally expensive, especially for complex functions.

		- Example

			- Yao's Garbled Circuits protocol (originally for the “Millionaires’ Problem”).

	- Oblivious Transfer (OT)

		- Key Concepts

			- A protocol ensuring one party can learn a piece of data from another without revealing which piece it requested, and without exposing anything else.

	- Hybrid Protocols

		- Key Concepts

			- Combine multiple methods (secret sharing + garbled circuits + homomorphic encryption + zero-knowledge proofs) for optimal performance and security.

- Use Case Examples

	- Enhancing federated learning 

		- SMPC ensures computations on distributed data without revealing individuals’ private information.

			- SMPC is suitable for scenarios requiring strong privacy guarantees but may have higher computational costs compared to TEEs.

	- Sharing insights from private datasets 

		- Allows multiple organizations (e.g., different hospitals) to pool data for large-scale analytics—yet keep each patient’s records confidential.

	- Financial and Supply Chain Analysis

		- Companies compute aggregated metrics (e.g., average wages, supply forecasts) without exposing raw data to potential competitors.

		- Example: JP Morgan's use of MPC for secure transactions or multi-party computations for private equity benchmarking.

	- Secure AI/ML

		- Training or inference on sensitive data (e.g., health records, genomic data) remains private during the entire ML pipeline.

	- Crypto Custody and Key Management

		- MPC-Based Web3 Wallets: Splits private keys among multiple parties, requiring joint participation to sign a transaction.

		- More secure than single private-key storage or even multi-sig wallets.

		- threshold cryptography distributes trust by requiring a subset of participants to jointly execute a cryptographic operation (e.g., signing transactions).

	- Secure Auctions and Bidding

		- Bids remain secret; only the winning bid is revealed (or partially revealed).

- Applications

	- Privacy-Preserving Data Analysis

	- Collaborative Machine Learning

	- Secure Auctions and Bidding

	- Genomic Research

	- Financial Services

	- Quantum-Safe (Potentially)

		- Breaking data into shares can mitigate the threat of quantum attacks in certain designs.

		- Examples: Quantum computers can't break secret-shared data without access to all shares.

- Challenges

	- Computation Overhead

		- SMPC protocols are generally slower than plaintext computations due to their complexity.

	- Communication Overhead

		- High communication requirements between participants can limit scalability.

	- Scalability

		- Performance can degrade as the number of participants or the complexity of the function increases.

	- Protocol Design Complexity
